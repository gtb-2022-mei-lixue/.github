# Introduction

This is a brief introduction about me.:grin:

My name is Lixue Mei. In chinese, that means *The plum blossom on the snowfield*.

I chose to be a programmer because *Person Of Interest* was my favorite show when I was in high school. And I think I've enjoyed this choice so far.:thinking:

### First Impression

My friends always told me that when they first saw me, they assumed that I'm one of the cold people. This is probably because I looked like a grown-up since I was a child.:raised_eyebrow:

But...I'm actually a people person, I like chatting with others and making new friends.:partying_face:

And this is me after walking on a windy day for half an hour:

My hair just ...:boom::boom::boom:

### Interests

My greatest interest is watching moives. *The devil wears Prada*, *V for Vendetta*, *Miss Sloane*, *La La Land*, *Frozen*...I guess I just don't have a certain type for movies, many different kinds of movies had left me profound influences.

### :cowboy_hat_face:So...

This is my brief introduction, and I'm looking forward to showing more of myself at Thoughtworks in the future.:laughing:
